# Introduction to Tactic Writing in Lean

We provide a single Lean file with 762 lines that teaches Lean tactic writing.
If you are interested in Lean tactic writing, we assume you already know Lean, and use VS Code,
in that case clone this repository, or just download [the file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirefek/lean-tactic-programming-quide/refs/heads/main/TacticProgrammingGuide.lean).

Alternatively, you can also copy it to [Lean 4 Web](https://live.lean-lang.org/) but you will miss the Ctrl-click feature.

We tried to explain all the basic concepts but keep it beginner friendly.
Enjoy learning Lean metaprogramming. If you are getting confused somewhere, it is probably not your fault. Let us know what needs more clarification. (we will put a link to a Zulip thread here)
